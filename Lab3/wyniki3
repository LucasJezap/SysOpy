Ponizej zebralem przykladowe wywolania funkcji generator,macierz oraz checker (sprawdza poprawnosc). Dla pierwszego wywolania czas dzialania procesu
okazal sie za maly przez co nie wszystkie macierze zostaly wymnozone poprawnie (nie zostaly calkowicie wymnozone). 
Kazdy przyklad poprzedzony jest odpowiednim wywolaniem w celu sprawdzenia czy dane sa poprawne.
Przyklad dzialania mnozenia macierzy zamiescilem w pliku wyniki2.
W porownaniu do programu z zad2 ten program dodatkowo pod uwage bierze twarde ograniczenia na czas dostepu procesora oraz rozmiar pamieci wirtualnej.
Odpowiednie wartosci dla kazdego procesu zostaly wypisane oraz poprzedzone odpowiednia nazwa.

1 mnozenie -> przemnozenie bloku macierzy A przez blok macierzy B

mode == 0 -> do wielu plikow
mode == 1 -> do jednego pliku
